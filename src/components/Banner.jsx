                In 1982, a group of vibrant and progressive youth in St. Anne
                Catholic Church, Ibara, Abeokuta who aggressively desired
                spiritual flavor by joining a church society were pulled
                together by common bond. Incidentally, members of the existing
                societies as at that time were old enough to be their fathers or
                at least their senior brothers. This informed their historic
                decision to establish a distinct and unique society of like
                minds and the initial effort culminated in the regular but
                informal meeting of the foundation members listed care below:

                On the 3rd of September 1982, the first formal meeting of the
                society was held and protem officers were elected. At the third
                meeting of the Society held on the 17th October, 1982, the
                following people were elected and sworn-in as the first
